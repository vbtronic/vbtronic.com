I love **programming** and **vibecoding** — using AI tools to help me build things faster. This very website is a great example.

I built **vbtronic.com** together with my dad using **Amp** and **Claude Code**. The AI generated most of the code and design, and we put the whole site together in a single day.

Through this project I learned the basics of web development, static site generators, Git, and automated deployment. And I'm always looking for the next thing to build!
