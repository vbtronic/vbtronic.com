I honestly think that **current world policies** are just terribly fragmented. There's no clear direction — everything is split up, rules go one way here and another way there, and none of it really fits together.

It just doesn't make sense to me. Why can't there be **one solid, unified approach** instead of this patchwork of random standards? It makes life harder for everyone who has to deal with it.

This isn't a political opinion — it's just something that really bugs me when I look at how the world works today.
