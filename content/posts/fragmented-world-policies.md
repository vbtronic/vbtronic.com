I honestly think that **current world policies** are just terribly fragmented. Every country does its own thing, international agreements fall apart, and nobody seems to be on the same page. Climate, trade, security — it's all over the place.

It just doesn't make sense to me. Why can't world leaders agree on **one solid, unified approach** instead of this patchwork where every country pulls in a different direction? It makes everything harder for everyone.

This isn't a political opinion and I'm not picking any side — it's just something that really bugs me when I look at how the world works today.
