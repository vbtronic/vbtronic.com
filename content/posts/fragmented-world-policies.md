I honestly think that **current world policies** are just terribly fragmented. Even allied countries can't seem to get on the same page. Climate, trade, security — they're supposed to be working together, but it's all over the place.

It really bugs me that **allied leaders can't agree** on a unified approach. If you're allies, why is everyone still pulling in a different direction? It just makes everything harder for everyone.

This isn't a political opinion and I'm not picking any side — it's just something that frustrates me when I look at how the world works today.
