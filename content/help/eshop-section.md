The **E-shop** is a planned feature that will allow visitors to browse and purchase digital products and services directly on vbtronic.com. It is currently under development.

## What you will see

When you open the E-shop page, you will find a preview of the upcoming store. All elements are greyed out and non-functional for now:

- **Cart icon** — A shopping cart button in the top-right corner of the page. Once active, this is where you will view items in your cart.
- **Products list** — A list of items available for purchase, with a search bar to find products. Each product shows its name, price, and two icon buttons: a cart icon (add to cart) and a coin icon (buy now).
- **Terms of E-shop** — A clickable card that will contain the terms and conditions for purchasing. Currently not expandable.

## What the E-shop will offer

The store is planned to feature four categories of products and services:

- **Expert Articles** — In-depth technical texts and analyses available behind a paywall. These go beyond regular blog posts with detailed research and professional insights.
- **Seminars** — In-person or online workshops on technical topics. Hands-on learning sessions with direct interaction.
- **Webinars** — Live online lectures and Q&A sessions. Scheduled events you can join from anywhere.
- **Products & Services** — Software, tools, and other digital products created by Viktor Brunclík.

## Coming Soon

At the bottom of the page, a prominent "Coming Soon" box indicates that the feature is not yet available. The E-shop will become functional once the site transitions from a static platform to a dynamic one with support for payments, user accounts, and product delivery.
