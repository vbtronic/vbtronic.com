This page explains the legal elements present on vbtronic.com and what they will do once the site becomes fully dynamic.

## Current status

The site is currently a static website. It does not collect any personal data, does not use cookies, does not include any third-party tracking or analytics, and does not process any user information. All legal elements described below are placeholders prepared for future use.

## Privacy Policy

A **Privacy Policy** card is displayed in the footer of every page. It is currently disabled. Once the site transitions to a dynamic platform and begins collecting or processing personal data, the privacy policy will detail:

- What data is collected and why
- How data is stored and protected
- Your rights regarding your data (access, deletion, etc.)
- Contact information for privacy-related inquiries

## Cookie consent

A **cookie consent banner** is displayed at the bottom of the screen on every page. It includes two buttons: "Accept All" and "Manage Preferences". Both buttons are currently disabled. Once the site transitions to a dynamic platform and begins using cookies, this banner will allow you to accept or manage your cookie preferences before any cookies are set.

Additionally, a **Cookie Preferences** card is displayed in the footer of every page, next to the Privacy Policy. It is also currently disabled. Once active, it will let you revisit your cookie settings at any time.

## Section-specific terms

Each section that involves user interaction has its own terms and conditions card:

- **Terms of E-shop** — Found on the E-shop page. Will contain terms and conditions for purchases, returns, and payment processing.
- **Terms of Feedback** — Found on the Feedback page. Will contain terms for submitting feedback, including how AI analyzes submissions.
- **Terms of About** — Found on the About Viktor Brunclík page. Will contain terms for user interactions such as likes, dislikes, and account-based features.

All section-specific terms cards are currently disabled and will become available once the respective features launch.

## AI disclosure

The footer of every page includes a transparency notice stating that this website and its articles are created by Viktor Brunclík with the help of AI tools (Amp and Claude Code), and that icons are generated by Claude Code.
