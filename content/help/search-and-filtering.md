vbtronic.com has built-in search and filtering to help you find content quickly.

## Home page search

The home page has a global search bar near the top. As you type, it shows matching results from both the Portfolio and Posts sections. The search checks both the title and description of each item. If nothing matches, a "No results found" message appears.

When you clear the search box, the results disappear and the normal home page layout returns.

## Section search

Both the **Portfolio** and **Posts** sections have their own search bars inside the "All Portfolio Items" or "All Posts" area. These work the same way — type to filter, and items that do not match are hidden instantly.

## Sort filters

Below each section's search bar, there are filter buttons:

- **Date & Time** — Sorts items by date, newest first. This is the default order.
- **A–Z** — Sorts items alphabetically by title.
- **Size** — Sorts items by word count, longest first.
- **Popularity** — This feature is not available yet and will be added in the future.

The currently active sort is highlighted with a cyan color. Sorting happens instantly without reloading the page.
