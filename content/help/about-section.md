You will find all of Viktor's published content here:

- **Portfolio items** — Achievements, projects, certificates, and creative work.
- **Articles** — Thoughts, opinions, analysis, and strategies on topics that interest Viktor.
- **Everything in one place** — All content is searchable and filterable, so you can quickly find what interests you.

## Page layout

When you open the About Viktor Brunclík section, you will see:

2. **Recently Added** — A grid of the 3 most recent items, displayed as cards with the date, title, and description.
3. **All Items** — A full list of every item below, with a search box and sorting options.

## Search and sorting

The item list has a search bar that filters items in real time as you type. You can also sort the list using the filter buttons:
