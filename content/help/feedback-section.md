The **Feedback** section is a planned feature that will allow visitors to submit feedback directly on the site. It is currently under development.

## What you will see

When you open the Feedback page, you will find a preview of the upcoming interface. All elements are greyed out and non-functional for now:

- **AI notice** — A banner stating that feedback is evaluated and analyzed by AI.
- **Add button** — A round "+" button in the center. Once active, this is where you will submit new feedback.
- **Your Feedback** — A list of all feedback you have submitted, with a search bar and filter buttons (All, Newest, Oldest) so you can find and sort your entries.
- **Terms of Feedback** — A section that will contain the terms and conditions for using the feedback feature. Currently empty.

## Coming Soon

At the bottom of the page, a prominent "Coming Soon" box indicates that the feature is not yet available. The Feedback section will become functional once the site transitions from a static platform to a dynamic one with backend support.

## How AI is involved

When the feature launches, all submitted feedback will be automatically evaluated and analyzed by AI. This helps identify common themes, sentiment, and priority suggestions to improve the site's content and services.
