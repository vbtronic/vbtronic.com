Welcome to **vbtronic.com** — the official website of **VB Tronic**, created by Viktor Brunclík.

## What is this site?

VB Tronic is a commercial platform and central hub where Viktor presents his projects, shares articles and opinions, and offers products and services. The site serves as a starting point — when you hear about a new service or product from VB Tronic, you come here and find your way to the dedicated website for that service.

## How is the site organized?

The site has five main sections, all accessible from the navigation bar at the top:

- **Home** — The landing page with a hero section, global search bar, recently added content, an "About This Web" card, and links to all sections with emphasis on the E-shop.
- **About Viktor Brunclík** — Everything about Viktor in one place: portfolio items, articles, achievements, and opinions, with search and filtering.
- **Help** — The section you are reading now. A guide to using this website.
- **Feedback** — A planned section where visitors will be able to submit feedback, which is evaluated and analyzed by AI. Currently under development (coming soon).
- **E-shop** — A planned store for expert articles, seminars, webinars, and digital products (coming soon).

## How was it built?

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (a static site generator) and hosted on GitHub Pages. Viktor built it together with his dad using the AI tools **Amp** and **Claude Code**. The design follows a dark engineering aesthetic with a cyan accent color.
