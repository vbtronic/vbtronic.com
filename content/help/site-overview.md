Welcome to **vbtronic.com** — the personal website of Viktor Brunclík.

## What is this site?

This is where Viktor shares his portfolio of achievements and projects, writes posts about topics that interest him, and documents his journey as a young builder and future entrepreneur.

## How is the site organized?

The site has five main sections, all accessible from the navigation bar at the top:

- **Home** — The landing page with a hero section, global search bar, recently added content, and an "About Me" card.
- **Portfolio** — Achievements, projects, and milestones. Things Viktor has built or accomplished.
- **Posts** — Thoughts, opinions, analysis, and strategies. Longer articles on topics that matter to Viktor.
- **Help** — The section you are reading now. A guide to using this website.
- **Feedback** — A planned section where visitors will be able to submit feedback, which is evaluated and analyzed by AI. Currently under development (coming soon).

## How was it built?

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (a static site generator) and hosted on GitHub Pages. Viktor built it together with his dad using the AI tools **Amp** and **Claude Code**. The design follows a dark engineering aesthetic with a cyan accent color.
