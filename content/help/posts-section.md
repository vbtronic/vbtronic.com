The **Posts** section is where Viktor shares his thoughts, opinions, analysis, and strategies.

## What are Posts?

Posts are longer articles on topics that interest Viktor. They can cover anything from world events to technology to personal reflections.

## Page layout

When you open the Posts section, you will see:

1. **Recently Added** — A grid of the 3 most recent posts at the top, displayed as cards with the date, title, and description.
2. **All Posts** — A full list of every post below, including a search box and sorting options.

## Search and sorting

The **All Posts** list has a search bar that filters posts in real time as you type. You can also sort the list using the filter buttons:

- **Date & Time** — Sort by newest first (default).
- **A–Z** — Sort alphabetically by title.
- **Size** — Sort by word count (longest first).
- **Popularity** — Coming soon.

Click any post to read the full article. Each article shows the publication date, title, description, and the full text.
