There are several ways to move around vbtronic.com.

## Navigation bar

The sticky header at the top of every page contains the site logo (**vbtronic.com**) and links to all main sections: **Home**, **Portfolio**, **Posts**, and **Help**. The currently active section is underlined.

The header stays visible as you scroll, so you can always switch sections quickly.

## Back and forward arrows

Every page (except the home page hero) has **left arrow** and **right arrow** buttons in the page header. These work like your browser's back and forward buttons but are designed specifically for navigating within the site.

## Breadcrumbs

When you are reading an individual article, the breadcrumb between the back/forward arrows shows which section the article belongs to (for example, "Portfolio" or "Help"). In the Help section, clicking the breadcrumb takes you back to the help topic list.

## Links in the About Me card

On the home page, the **About Me** card contains direct links to the Portfolio, Posts, and Help sections.
