The **Portfolio** section showcases Viktor's achievements, projects, and milestones.

## What is in the Portfolio?

Portfolio items include things like certificates, personal projects, and creative work. Examples include the story of building this website, language certificates, and writing interests.

## Page layout

When you open the Portfolio section, you will see:

1. **Recently Added** — A grid of the 3 most recent portfolio items at the top, displayed as cards with the date, title, and description.
2. **All Portfolio Items** — A full list of every item below, with a search box and sorting options.

## Search and sorting

- **Date & Time** — Sort by newest first (default).
- **A–Z** — Sort alphabetically by title.
- **Size** — Sort by word count (longest first).
